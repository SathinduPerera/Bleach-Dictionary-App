        "description": "Shunsui Sakuranosuke Jirō Kyōraku (京楽 次郎 総蔵佐 春水, Kyōraku no Jirō Sakuranosuke Shunsui) is the captain of the 1st Division and Captain-Commander of the Gotei 13. His lieutenants are his niece, Nanao Ise, and Genshirō Okikiba. He is the former captain of the 8th Division. Shunsui is a tall, light-skinned Shinigami with high cheekbones, grey eyes and long wavy brown hair. His hair is tied in a long ponytail and has long bangs that frame the left side of his face. He also has a noticeable amount of body hair on his chest, feet, and arms. He wears a Sugegasa straw hat and a pink, flowered lady's kimono, which he drapes across his shoulders and over his Shihakushō. Although his haori and obi sash are cheap, his pin-wheel hairpins are very expensive. He does not wear tabi with his sandals. He has thin facial hair around his mouth and on his cheeks. Over a hundred years before Sōsuke Aizen's defection, Shunsui only had facial hair on his upper mouth. After the battle with the Wandenreich, Shunsui wears an eyepatch over his right eye that was damaged during the conflict. The top half of his right ear is sliced off at a slight tilt with a scar along his right temple. As a child, Shunsui had shorter and messier hair. He wore a flower patterned kimono."

        "description": "Genryūsai Shigekuni Yamamoto (山本元柳斎 重國, Yamamoto Genryūsai Shigekuni) was the captain of the 1st Division in the Gotei 13 and also the Captain-Commander of the whole Gotei 13. His lieutenant was Chōjirō Sasakibe. After being cast into Hell, he has gained the epithet of \"Founder of the Gotei\" (護廷開祖, Gotei Kaiso; Viz \"Court Guard Founder\"). Yamamoto is a fair-skinned man of average height. The oldest captain in the Gotei 13, he has aged into a elderly man with a bald head, deep wrinkles, hooked nose, and pronounced cheekbones. He has red eyes,[4] long eyebrows, long mustache, and a hip-length white beard secured by a purple band crossing down it. He has many scars on his body, with the two most prominent being a pair of long scars crossing above his right eye, one of which was left by his battle with his lieutenant.[5] In addition to the standard black shihakushō, he wears a captain's long-sleeved haori draped over his back instead of actually wearing it, with its size being greatly exaggerated. Despite his old and frail demeanor, often standing in a slouch, he in fact has a very muscular and well-defined built, which he only reveals when serious for battle, something which Shunsui Kyōraku claims is not seen too often. After his confrontation with Sōsuke Aizen, Yamamoto lost his left arm.[6]When he was much younger, Yamamoto had black hair on the sides of his head, and was bald on top. He had a tuft of hair sticking up at the back of his head in a topknot. He had thick but more manageable eyebrows and mustache with no beard. He had a single large scar on his forehead, which earned him the nickname \"Eijisai\" due to its shape. He had a prominent crease on his forehead and beneath his eyes, and shallow cheeks. He wore the typical Shinigami outfit, with the addition of a sleeveless captain's haori worn appropriately."
